        <h2> Our History </h2>
        <p> We Five was founded in june 2020 by Samantha, with a mission of making orchestral music accessible and affordable for everyone.</p>
        <p> Music Director Angela expanded that mission when she joined september 2020, creating thematic concerts that explore music from the perspective of the visual arts, literature, religion, and history,</p>
        <p>she also revived rarely-performed works that audiences would otherwise never have a chance to hear performed live.</p>
        
        <h2> Our mission</h2>
        <p> The mission of the We Five is to renew live orchestral music as a vital force in contemporary American culture</p>
        <p>  To this end, We Five presents thematic programming, in which musical works are curated around ideas drawn from a variety of disciplines such as history, visual arts, science, politics and literature.</p>
        <p>  We Five pursues innovation in concert presentation and is devoted to the promotion of musical education.</p>
